Robotics engineer who is passionate, self-motivated and excels in a team environment. I'm interested in legged robots, aerial robots and applications in (multi-robot) mobile manipulation. Particularly
interested in leveraging learning-based algorithms for planning and control to enable robust performance in
real-world robotic systems. I envision a future where humans are relieved from dangerous and repetitive tasks. I would say my biggest strength is my passion for the field, which gives me the fulfilment and motivation to work on new, challenging projects.

**Currently looking for PhD positions in Robotics** starting summer/fall 2025!.

I am finishing my Master's degree in Robotics at TU Delft (2023-2025), with my thesis at the [Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab](https://autonomousrobots.nl/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft (2019-2022) with cum laude distinction, and spent a semester at EPFL (2021-2022). Next to that I have industry experience in locomotion for a medical exoskeleton at [Project MARCH](https://www.projectmarch.nl/) (2022-2023) and as student Robotics Engineer at [Prime Vision](https://primevision.com/) (2023-2024).
