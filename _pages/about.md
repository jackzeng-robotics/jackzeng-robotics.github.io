I’m a PhD student in robotics at EPFL at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) under Prof. Dario Floreano. My current research focus is on vision-based aerial swarming and multi-agent learning by taking inspiration from biological swarms. Feel free to reach out! 

Before that, I graduated from TU Delft with an MSc in Robotics. I'm interested in aerial and legged robots, multi-agent systems and mobile manipulation. I'm very passionate and motivated about robotics and especially the use of learning-based methods.

I finished my Master's degree in Robotics at TU Delft (2023-2025) with cum laude distinction, with my thesis at the [Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab](https://autonomousrobots.nl/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft (2019-2022) with cum laude distinction, and spent a semester at EPFL (2021-2022). Next to that I have industry experience in bipdeal locomotion for a medical exoskeleton at [Project MARCH](https://www.projectmarch.nl/) (2022-2023) and as student Robotics Engineer at [Prime Vision](https://primevision.com/) (2023-2024) working on fleets of autonomous sorting robots.
